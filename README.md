# RPG Game Abstraction using POO

## Classes

**Hero**: this class is abstraction of a hero in the game. So other classes like "Knight" and "Wizard" has the same properties and some methods (action).

**Knight**/**White Wizard**/**Black Wizard**: These are specific classes that inherits from the abstract class Hero. I can use the same properties and overload some methods to fit with different kinds of attacks and defenses.
